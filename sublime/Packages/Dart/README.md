# Dart – Sublime Text Package

 Works on **OS X**, **Linux** and **Windows**


## Overview

Basic Dart support for Sublime Text 3. These are the current features at a
glance:

* Syntax highlighting
* Comment/uncomment lines and text blocks
* Snippets
* JavaScript translation through `dart2js` using ST3's build system
* Pub support to manage Dart packages
* Code linting using `dartanalyzer`
* Basic symbol navigation using ST3's built-in symbol indexing

Most features are only active in files with a `.dart` extension.

Check out or [introductory video][6] for a short tutorial on using this package.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to take full advantage of this package.

1. [Download and install the Dart SDK][sdk]
2. Make sure the SDK's `bin` directory is on your PATH
3. Set the `dartsdk_path` variable in your ST3 user settings

##### Example:

```json
    {
      "dartsdk_path" : "/Users/foo/dart-sdk"
    }
```


## Installation

You can install the Dart package in two ways.

### Using Package Control

Installing through the [Package Control][1] plugin is the recommended way:

- Open the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> or <kbd>⌘+Shift+P</kbd>)
- Type 'install'
- Select **Package Control: Install Package**
- Type 'Dart'
- Select 'Dart'

You may need to restart ST3 before you can start using all the features in the
package.

### Manually

- Clone this repository
- Copy its content to a new *Dart* directory inside *Packages*

To quickly open your *Packages* folder, select **Preferences → Browse Packages**
from the ST3 menu or use the command palette.

Looking for an IDE experience? Try [Dart Editor][2], the
[Dart plugin for Eclipse][3], or the [Dart plugin for IntelliJ/WebStorm][4].

## Using the Build System

<kbd>Ctrl+B</kbd>/<kbd>⌘+B</kbd> will run the `dart2js` compiler on the active
file.

Browse other Dart commands via ST3's command pallete: `Run`, `Analyzer`,
`pub install`, `pub update`…


## Using the Linter

### Getting Started

The code linter is deactivated by default. To activate this feature you must
set the `dartlint_active` setting to `true`.

(You may need to make this change in `Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings`
or in a `Dart.sublime-settings` file within your `Packages/User` folder.)

##### Example:

```json
{
  "dartlint_active" : true
}
```

### Configuration

The linter will run when Dart scripts are loaded or saved. You can change this
behavior through the `dartlint_on_load` and `dartlint_on_save` settings.


### Customizing Highlight Colors

Use the following settings:

- `dartlint_underline_color_error`
- `dartlint_underline_color_warning`
- `dartlint_underline_color_info`

To customize gutter icons:

`dartlint_gutter_icon_error`
`dartlint_gutter_icon_warning`
`dartlint_gutter_icon_info`

Paths to icons must start at the *Packages* directory.

##### Example:

```json
{
  "dartlint_gutter_icon_error" : "Packages/Users/Icons/error.png"
}
```

### Linter Popup Configuration

Use `dartlint_show_popup_level` setting to control when the pop up should
show. Valid values are:

- `ERROR`
- `WARNING`
- `INFO`
