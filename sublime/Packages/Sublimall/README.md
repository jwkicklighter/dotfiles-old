Sublimall
=========

**Warning**: Sublimall is only for Sublime Text 3!

Sublimall is the way to sync and save your SublimeText configuration everywhere. Just create an account, install the plugin and that's all.
Sublimall is an opensource, [server](https://sublimall.org) and [plugin](https://github.com/socketubs/Sublimall).

Server side can't read your configuration because its encrypted locally by your SublimeText.

It allows you to encrypt your package in order to increase your privacy. Let's start today!

Visit [Sublimall](https://sublimall.org/) website.
